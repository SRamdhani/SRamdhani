# Hi, I'm Satesh ðŸ‘‹
A principal data scientist with over 5 years of professional experience. I have a strong background in statistics, in particular it's applicability with neural network and applied problems.
I've worked end-to-end as a data scientist & machine learning engineer with deployments for monolithic, or microservice architectures. I have a few opensource projects and I maintain an active 
interest in personal research in particular statistics and machine learning loss function optimizations.

### Key points
*   Trained statistician with broad experience around low parameter theoretical models & high parameter machine/deep learning.
*   Experience with a variety of problems: Chatbot, Anomaly Detection, Genetic Networks, Classifier Trees, Human Resources & Company Statistical Benchmarking, Wireless RSSI Spatial Kriging, 
Warehouse Logistics, Text Summarization, and Process Mining in Python. 
*   I write research papers with the expectation for peer review. 

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
*   Python/R/Java languages
*   MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
*   FastAPI, Flask, Spring Framework
*   Tensorflow/Keras/PyTorch/H20
*   GitHub/GitLab

### My opensource projects
*   [Stocks](https://github.com/SRamdhani/Stocks) - Stock Trading Streamlit Application
*   [Graph Emeddings](https://github.com/SRamdhani/Graph-Embeddings) - Leveraging a basic graph structure to develop skip grams to model embeddings for nodes.
*   [SpatioTemporal Analysis](https://github.com/SRamdhani/Spatiotemporal) - Recreation of Amato's (2020) framework to model spatiotemporal data.
*   [eGPT](https://github.com/SRamdhani/eGPT) - Combination of GPT and classification out of curiousity.
